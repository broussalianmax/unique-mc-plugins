Here are some strange minecraft plugins!

Item Sprint -
When a player toggles sprint, a random item from current MC version is given to the player.

Social Distancing (COVID-19) -
If a player is within 6 blocks (x,y,z) of another player, they both will explode.

Shear Items -
If a player sheers a sheep instead of wool, it gives a random item.

Drop Explosions -
If a player drops an item, it will explode 3 seconds later.
