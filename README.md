# Unique Minecraft Plugins

Plugins, plugins and more plugins. I love making plugins.

## List of all plugins

[Drop Explosions](https://github.com/broussalianmax/unique-mc-plugins/tree/DropExplosions)  - When you drop an item, the item explodes the area quickly after. 

[Item Sprint](https://github.com/broussalianmax/unique-mc-plugins/tree/ItemSprint) - When you toggle sprint, the game gives you a random item.

[Kamikaze Creepers](https://github.com/broussalianmax/unique-mc-plugins/tree/Kamikaze-Creepers) - Creepers now have learned to fly, good luck.

[Shear Items](https://github.com/broussalianmax/unique-mc-plugins/tree/ShearItems) - When you shear a sheep, it gives you a random item.

[Social Distancing](https://github.com/broussalianmax/unique-mc-plugins/tree/Social-distancing) - When you get within 6 blocks of a player (X,Y,Z) You both explode.

[Swap Blocks](https://github.com/broussalianmax/unique-mc-plugins/tree/SwapBlocks) - When you swap items, blocks change - this also happens when you crouch.
